    "text": "Hi! Welcome to my dissertation website. I started my PhD in Management Science & Engineering at University of Waterloo in August 2021. This website will walk you through my entire project, which took me over 3 years to finish. I’m hoping this project can be used by others as inspiration, and hopefully, as a portfolio project for my own! I find a lot of this stuff fun! I’m also hoping to make everything super accessible to everyone, even if you’re coming from no background in Statistics/Math/Computer Science.",

    "text": "Hi! My Name is Yekta (read exactly how you write it), my pronouns are She/Her. I was born in Tehran, Iran. Since I was a kid, I’ve always loved learning and adventures. Movies are my first passion! After that, it’s TV shows, music, gadgets and technology, books, writing and studying! Yes! I actually like studying!\nI quickly found out I was much better at Math and Physics than Science and any other field that required memorizing facts (History). I wanted to be an astronaut, then an actress, then a filmmaker, then a writer, then a super model (plans didn’t work out, I stopped growing taller at 14!), then a robotics engineer, then a computer engineer, then an electrical engineer, then a photographer, etc. I thought actor was the one that made the most sense, since I wanted to be so many things! At least with acting, I could pretend to be all of those things!\nWell, I chose mathematics in highschool, and since I was good at it, I continued with mathematics to college. Big Mistake (For Me)! Studying math in undergrad at University of Tehran was like studying Chinese, Greek, Russian and Arabic at the same time. You don’t see numbers after Calculus 2, which you take in the second semester/term. All abstract ideas, proofs, theorems, n-dimensional spaces and curves that curve inside of themselves! “I should have studied Accounting!” (Which I did, btw! I actually took an entire accounting training course outside of university and found it to be sould-crushingly boring, no offense to all accountants.)\nOk, so if math isn’t about numbers and I don’t actually want to work with numbers - then where do I go?! So, thankfully, at UT, I was able to take most of my electives courses from the two other majors in the math department: computer science and statistics. This was the turning point for me. “Here’s where that theory applies, you know, the one you kept asking why you’re even learning its proof”… So I figured I should change my major. Mathematics had taught me nothing but how to think, how to analyze, how to be logical and how important it was to know why stuff made sense… so really, nothing much! I didn’t even realize how much studying mathematics had taught me until years later.\nI still changed my major for graduate school, and decided to try Industrial & Systems Engineering, with a specialization on Macrosystems engineering. I taught myself Python and SQL, I did very well during graduate school with my courses, I worked on research projects and had the best time writing my thesis. So I thought, wow, I actually like all of this! Why not do a PhD? And here I am! I love learning, getting deep in a topic, planning a project from the start to the end."

This is an aggregation that happens under the hood, and using position = \"fill\" will actually make sure all the bars consider things relative to eachother, filling the full 100% of the bar.\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(Year), fill = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(fill = \"Theme\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Count\") +\n  fill_palette(\"Set3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see how things move/flow over the years, a line chart is a great idea:\n\ndf %&gt;%\n    dplyr::count(DecisionTheme, Year) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = n, color = DecisionTheme, group = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(fill = \"Theme\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Count\") +\n  fill_palette(\"Dark2\")",

Despite the advantages, m-banking adoption rates vary significantly. Adoption is the early stage usage or uptake of a technology. My dissertation aims to bridge critical gaps in understanding how different factors (according to literature trends and through novel contributions) and device-specific attributes shape m-banking adoption. The central research question addressed in this dissertation is: “What are the factors that influence mobile banking adoption across different user segments?”\nThe current chapter is a holistic introduction to the dissertation. To answer the main research question, I conducted three distinct yet interconnected studies. These studies, presented in chronological order in the following chapters, are:\nTheoretical Contributions\nThis dissertation makes several contributions to the field of technology adoption and financial services research.\nPractical Contributions",

    "text": "1 ### The Inner Workings of Mobile Banking Adoption: A Systematic Literature Review of Intrinsic Factors\nDespite extensive research on m-banking adoption, a clear framework categorizing user-specific influences is still missing.\nAfter investigating the m-banking adoption literature, I found that uniform definitions for factors 1 influencing m-banking adoption was lacking. Furthermore, there was an over-reliance on only a few factors and theoretical frameworks. This prompted the undertaking of the SLR study in study 1. To address the problem of lack of uniform definitions, I categorized adoption factors based on context and impact. This way, using group/category membership help identify similarities between factors. Thus making definitions more cohesive.\nSeveral studies support the idea that categorization helps in defining and understanding concepts more easily. Research suggests that categorization plays a crucial role in defining concepts, moving from a classical view (fixed definitions) to a probabilistic view where categorization helps in making sense of concepts based on shared characteristics Medin (1989). Categorization enables more effective organization and processing of information which are essential for learning new concepts (zentallCATEGORIZATIONCONCEPTLEARNING2002?).\nTechnology adoption factors are complex and often belong to multiple categories. Because of this, studies have never explicitly categorized factors across the board. I adopt a broad approach to classifying factors, focusing on two key dimensions of decision-making based on how they relate to the user: Intrinsic and Extrinsic. In the context of m-banking adoption, intrinsic factors discuss how individuals evaluate an m-banking application (Often shortened to “app”) internally — based on perceptions, goals, pressure felt from other people’s judgment, and emotions. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, refer to the apps’ measurable features, such as performance and functionality. Since extrinsic factors are easy to quantify and experienced similarly across the board, they are also straightforward to study. Thus, I focused on intrinsic factors. Because intrinsic factors relate to so many different inner processes (mentioned above), I further categorized them into four main groups:\n\nPerceptive, which are based on beliefs and perceptions.\nPersonal, which are based on individual motivations and traits.\nSocial, which are based on the impact of others on the decision-maker.\nPsychological, which are based on based on cognitive, emotional and mental processes.\n\nThis categorization provides a useful context-specific grouping. Following this, a systematic search of the m-banking literature for intrinsic factors was carried out. Scientific articles gathered were given themes using text-mining techniques – specifically, lda for Topic Modeling. Some of these themes matched my categorization, as well. I also extended prior SLR studies by using statistical techniques – specifically, anova – to mathematically validate my findings. My results provide a strong empirical foundation for future researchers to do context-focused investigation.\nThe Outcome of this study is to help enhance the understanding of intrinsic factors, highlight underutilized methodologies, and identify research gaps. Additionally, I highlight the dominance of certain theoretical models while advocating for greater exploration of under-studied theories and methods. My findings show notable geographical and study-design biases, particularly longitudinal research in developed nations. My categorized framework helps scholars identify intrinsic factors, relevant theories, and research gaps, which promotes targeted future research.\nFor practitioners and policymakers, I recommend designing emotionally engaging apps, ensuring transparent risk communication, and educating users on safe practices. These steps enhance m-banking adoption and effectiveness.\n\n1.1 The Relationship Between Mental Health and Mobile Banking Adoption: Evidence from Canada\nFollowing the work of the previous study, I focused on intrinsic factors. One of the factors I found to be under-explored in the literature was mental health.\nPsychological factors are comparatively less-studied across the m-banking literature Venkatesh et al. (2012), Zou et al. (2023-05, 2023), Tiwari et al. (2021-12, 2021). I verified this further doing a quick preliminary search on Web-of-Science. Using the following search query returned 1,067 studies with no filters set on the results: !30(“mobile banking” OR “mbanking” OR “m-banking”) AND (“adoption”) When changing the search query to find studies specifically on psychological factors, the total number of studies returned were 157, which is about 14\\% of the total. The new search query was: !30\\parbox0.8 (“mobile banking” OR “mbanking” OR “m-banking”) AND \\ (“adoption”) AND (“affective” OR “psychological” OR “affect based” OR “affect-based” OR “emotional” OR “cognitive” OR “mental” OR “personal”)  \\ Using the same search queries in Scopus, 753 results were returned for the first, and 101 in the second search (13.4\\%). It is clear that only a small portion of the literature in m-banking adoption is focused on psychological factors.\nIn this study, I investigated the direct and moderated effect of mh on m-banking adoption. Moderators were extracted from theories in technology adoption or from literature related to mental health: rs, sd, and sns. I used a fixed effect logistic regression model grouped based on Canadian provinces following the cluster sampling design of my dataset. The results showed that mental health significantly and negatively affects m-banking adoption: better mental health outcomes were associated with lower likelihood of m-banking adoption. I did not find sufficient evidence for the moderating effects.\n%———————————————————————- Device Divide: Unpacking Mobile Banking Adoption Differences for Smartphones and Smart Wearable Devices -section-p3 %———————————————————————- Moving on from focusing only on smartphones, I decided to do a comparative study considering newer devices used in m-banking. One of the findings of my SLR study from Section -section-p2 was that few comparative studies exist in general, and studies that focus on various tools used for m-banking are increasingly important. In this chapter, I examined the nuances of m-banking adoption across two mobile devices: smartphones and smart wearable devices. I investigated the impact of the following factors: trust, perceived security, perceived value (time savings), and demographic variables. Demographic factors are important as numerous studies identify these (e.g., age, gender, income, and education) as key factors influencing m-banking adoption Chawla & Joshi (2018), lyInternetBankingAdoption2022e.\nThe results from this chapter are device-specific insights. This study also refines existing technology adoption models. Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to compare behavioral differences between smartphone and smart wearable users in the context of m-banking. I found that trust impacts smartphone users more strongly, while wearable users prioritize time efficiency. Users perceived smartphones as more secure. Demographic factors such as age, education, and gender exhibited varying influences based on device type as well.\n\n\n1.2 References"
